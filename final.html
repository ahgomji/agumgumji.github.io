<h2>Varietal</h2>
<p>Coffee varietals have memorable, rich histories and produce distinctive, rare flavor characteristics in cup. The four most common arabica varietals are Bourbon, Typica, Caturra and Catuai. Bourbon and Typica are the original purebreds, the ancestors of all coffee trees. Caturra and Catuai are descendants of Bourbon-hybrids created by combining (naturally or artificially) two existing coffee varietals to create an entirely new one.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>About Starbucks
It happens millions of times each week — a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista — but each interaction is unique.

It's just a moment in time — just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand. But it's a connection.

We make sure everything we do honors that connection — from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.

From our beginnings as a single store over 40 years ago, in every place that we've been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it. Learn more about Our Company.</p>
